### Project Background

The client company currently relies on manual financial statement analysis to evaluate borrower feasibility for working capital loans. This traditional approach is time-consuming, prone to human error, and limits the speed of decision-making. Financial analysts must manually calculate numerous financial ratios, analyze trends across multiple periods, and cross-reference various financial metrics before reaching a creditworthiness decision. This manual process creates bottlenecks in the loan approval workflow and increases operational costs.

### Problem Statement

The organization lacks an automated, systematic approach to assess borrower feasibility based on comprehensive financial statement analysis. Key challenges include:

- **Manual Processing**: Financial analysis is conducted manually for each applicant, requiring significant time and resources
- **Inconsistency**: Different analysts may apply varying judgment criteria, leading to inconsistent decisions
- **Scalability**: Current processes cannot efficiently handle large volumes of borrower applications
- **Decision Delays**: The time required for feasibility assessment delays loan approval decisions
- **Limited Visibility**: Stakeholders lack real-time insights into the key financial health indicators

### Solution

This project automates the financial feasibility assessment process by implementing:

- **Automated Financial Analysis**: Systematic calculation of financial ratios (liquidity, solvency, profitability, efficiency) from raw financial statements
- **Decision Rules Engine**: Pre-defined decision rules and thresholds to classify borrowers as "Feasible", "Conditional", or "Not Feasible"
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning models to predict creditworthiness and risk levels
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual analytics dashboard providing key metrics, trend analysis, and decision support
- **Integrated Reporting**: Comprehensive reports combining quantitative analysis with visual representations

**Outcome**: Faster, more accurate, and consistent borrower feasibility assessments with improved decision support for credit officers.
